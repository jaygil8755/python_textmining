2023-10-31,Decoding The Digital Fuku: Deciphering Colonial Legacies to Critically Assess ChatGPT in Dominican Education,Anaelia Ovalle,"Educational disparities within the Dominican Republic (DR) have long-standing
origins rooted in economic, political, and social inequity. Addressing these
challenges has necessarily called for capacity building with respect to
educational materials, high-quality instruction, and structural resourcing.
Generative AI tools like ChatGPT have begun to pique the interest of Dominican
educators due to their perceived potential to bridge these educational gaps.
However, a substantial body of AI fairness literature has documented ways AI
disproportionately reinforces power dynamics reflective of jurisdictions
driving AI development and deployment policies, collectively termed the AI
Global North. As such, indiscriminate adoption of this technology for DR
education, even in part, risks perpetuating forms of digital coloniality.
Therefore, this paper centers embracing AI-facilitated educational reform by
critically examining how AI-driven tools like ChatGPT in DR education may
replicate facets of digital colonialism. We provide a concise overview of
20th-century Dominican education reforms following the 1916 US occupation.
Then, we employ identified neocolonial aspects historically shaping Dominican
education to interrogate the perceived advantages of ChatGPT for contemporary
Dominican education, as outlined by a Dominican scholar. This work invites AI
Global North & South developers, stakeholders, and Dominican leaders alike to
exercise a relational contextualization of data-centric epistemologies like
ChatGPT to reap its transformative benefits while remaining vigilant of

attention recently, including among students. However, while the debate on
ChatGPT in academia is making waves, more understanding is needed among
lecturers and teachers on how students use and perceive ChatGPT. To address
this gap, we analyzed the content on ChatGPT available on TikTok in February
2023. TikTok is a rapidly growing social media platform popular among
individuals under 30. Specifically, we analyzed the content of the 100 most
popular videos in English tagged with #chatgpt, which collectively garnered
over 250 million views. Most of the videos we studied promoted the use of
ChatGPT for tasks like writing essays or code. In addition, many videos
discussed AI detectors, with a focus on how other tools can help to transform
ChatGPT output to fool these detectors. This also mirrors the discussion among
educators on how to treat ChatGPT as lecturers and teachers in teaching and
grading. What is, however, missing from the analyzed clips on TikTok are videos
that discuss ChatGPT producing content that is nonsensical or unfaithful to the
training data."
2024-02-21,A Study on the Vulnerability of Test Questions against ChatGPT-based Cheating,"Shanker Ram, Chen Qian","ChatGPT is a chatbot that can answer text prompts fairly accurately, even
performing very well on postgraduate-level questions. Many educators have found
that their take-home or remote tests and exams are vulnerable to ChatGPT-based
cheating because students may directly use answers provided by tools like
ChatGPT. In this paper, we try to provide an answer to an important question:
how well ChatGPT can answer test questions and how we can detect whether the
questions of a test can be answered correctly by ChatGPT. We generated
ChatGPT's responses to the MedMCQA dataset, which contains over 10,000 medical
school entrance exam questions. We analyzed the responses and uncovered certain
types of questions ChatGPT answers more inaccurately than others. In addition,
we have created a basic natural language processing model to single out the
most vulnerable questions to ChatGPT in a collection of questions or a sample
exam. Our tool can be used by test-makers to avoid ChatGPT-vulnerable test
questions."

2024-01-31,ChatGPT in the classroom. Exploring its potential and limitations in a Functional Programming course,Dan-Matei Popovici,"In November 2022, OpenAI has introduced ChatGPT, a chatbot based on
supervised and reinforcement learning. Not only can it answer questions
emulating human-like responses, but it can also generate code from scratch or
complete coding templates provided by the user. ChatGPT can generate unique
responses which render any traditional anti-plagiarism tool useless. Its
release has ignited a heated debate about its usage in academia, especially by
students. We have found, to our surprise, that our students at POLITEHNICA
University of Bucharest (UPB) have been using generative AI tools (ChatGPT and
its predecessors) for solving homework, for at least 6 months. We therefore set
out to explore the capabilities of ChatGPT and assess its value for educational
purposes. We solved all our coding assignments for the semester from our UPB
Functional Programming course. We discovered that, although ChatGPT provides
correct answers in 68% of the cases, only around half of those are legible
solutions which can benefit students in some form. On the other hand, ChatGPT
has a very good ability to perform code review on student programming homework.
Based on these findings, we discuss the pros and cons of ChatGPT in education."

examines problem solving strategies. In a study, students with a background in
physics were assigned to solve physics exercises, with one group having access
to an internet search engine (N=12) and the other group being allowed to use
ChatGPT (N=27). We evaluated their performance, strategies, and interaction
with the provided tools. Our results showed that nearly half of the solutions
provided with the support of ChatGPT were mistakenly assumed to be correct by
the students, indicating that they overly trusted ChatGPT even in their field
of expertise. Likewise, in 42% of cases, students used copy & paste to query
ChatGPT -- an approach only used in 4% of search engine queries -- highlighting
the stark differences in interaction behavior between the groups and indicating
limited reflection when using ChatGPT. In our work, we demonstrated a need to
(1) guide students on how to interact with LLMs and (2) create awareness of
potential shortcomings for users."

ChatGPT challenges various learning and assessment formats as it significantly
reduces the effectiveness of their learning and assessment functionalities. In
particular, ChatGPT might be applied to formats that require learners to
generate text, such as bachelor theses or student research papers. Accordingly,
the research question arises to what extent writing of bachelor theses is still
a valid learning and assessment format. Correspondingly, in this study, the
first author was asked to write his bachelor's thesis exploiting ChatGPT. For
tracing the impact of ChatGPT, methodically an autoethnographic approach was
used. First, all considerations on the potential use of ChatGPT were documented
in logs and secondly, all ChatGPT chats were logged. Both logs and chat
histories were analyzed and are presented along to the recommendations for
students regarding the use of ChatGPT suggested by Gimpel et al. (2023). In
conclusion, ChatGPT is beneficial in thesis writing during various activities,
such as brainstorming, structuring and text revision. However, there arise
limitations, e.g., in referencing. Thus, ChatGPT requires a continuous
validation of the outcomes generated fostering learning. Currently, ChatGPT is

A study on the perceived scientific accuracy and linguistic quality,"Merten Nikolay Dahlkemper, Simon Zacharias Lahme, Pascal Klein","This study aimed at evaluating how students perceive the linguistic quality
and scientific accuracy of ChatGPT responses to physics comprehension
questions. A total of 102 first- and second-year physics students were
confronted with three questions of progressing difficulty from introductory
mechanics (rolling motion, waves, and fluid dynamics). Each question was
presented with four different responses. All responses were attributed to
ChatGPT, but in reality one sample solution was created by the researchers. All
ChatGPT responses obtained in this study were wrong, imprecise, incomplete, or
misleading. We found little differences in the perceived linguistic quality
between ChatGPT responses and the sample solution. However, the students rated
the overall scientific accuracy of the responses significantly differently,
with the sample solution being rated best for the questions of low and medium
difficulty. The discrepancy between the sample solution and the ChatGPT
responses increased with the level of self-assessed knowledge of the question
content. For the question of highest difficulty (fluid dynamics) that was
unknown to most students, a ChatGPT response was rated just as good as the
sample solution. Thus, this study provides data on the students' perception of
ChatGPT responses and the factors influencing their perception. The results
highlight the need for careful evaluation of ChatGPT responses both by
instructors and students, particularly regarding scientific accuracy.
Therefore, future research could explore the potential of similar ""spot the

attention in higher education. This study aims to understand how universities
establish policies regarding the use of AI tools and explore the factors that
influence their decisions. Our study examines ChatGPT policies implemented at
universities around the world, including their existence, content, and issuance
dates. Specifically, we analyzed the top 500 universities according to the 2022
QS World University Rankings. Our findings indicate that there is significant
variation in university policies. Less than one-third of the universities
included in the study had implemented ChatGPT policies. Of the universities
with ChatGPT policies, approximately 67 percent embraced ChatGPT in teaching
and learning, more than twice the number of universities that banned it. The
majority of the universities that ban the use of ChatGPT in assessments allow
individual instructors to deviate from this restrictive policy. Our empirical
analysis identifies several factors that are significantly and positively
correlated with a university's likelihood of having a ChatGPT policy, including
the university's academic reputation score, being in an English-speaking
country, and the general public attitudes toward ChatGPT. In addition, we found
that a university's likelihood of having a ban policy is positively associated
with faculty student ratio, citations, and the English-speaking country dummy,

potentials to enhance educational research. For example, generative large
language models were shown to be capable to solve quantitative reasoning tasks
in physics and concept tests such as the Force Concept Inventory. Given the
importance of such concept inventories for physics education research, and the
challenges in developing them such as field testing with representative
populations, this study seeks to examine to what extent a generative large
language model could be utilized to generate a synthetic data set for the FCI
that exhibits content-related variability in responses. We use the recently
introduced ChatGPT based on the GPT 4 generative large language model and
investigate to what extent ChatGPT could solve the FCI accurately (RQ1) and
could be prompted to solve the FCI as-if it were a student belonging to a
different cohort (RQ2). Furthermore, we study, to what extent ChatGPT could be
prompted to solve the FCI as-if it were a student having a different force- and
mechanics-related misconception (RQ3). In alignment with other research, we
found the ChatGPT could accurately solve the FCI. We furthermore found that
prompting ChatGPT to respond to the inventory as-if it belonged to a different
cohort yielded no variance in responses, however, responding as-if it had a
certain misconception introduced much variance in responses that approximate
real human responses on the FCI in some regards."

2023-06-03,Befriending ChatGPT and other superchatbots: An AI-integrated take-home assessment preserving integrity,P G Kubendran Amos,"With the launch of ChatGPT, serious concerns have reasonably been raised of
its ill-effect on the integrity of remote take-home exams. By way of mitigating
the concern, in this study, a rather straightforward Artificial-Intelligence
(AI)-integrated take-home assessment technique is proposed, and the outcome of
its practice is discussed. Despite involving AI, in the form of ChatGPT, the
assessment adheres to the convention of posing questions invoking critical
thinking and problem solving skills. However, AI is characteristically
integrated in this assessment by instructing the learners to employ ChatGPT as
one of the primary sources. The learners are directed to report the use of
ChatGPT by including both the prompts and its responses, before expressing
their thoughts on AI-generated answers and their own concluding statement.
These three characteristic components of the present techniques -- the handling
of ChatGPT through the prompts, comments on the AI-responses and the concluding
thoughts -- are evaluated to gauge the learning.
  The proposed assessment was assigned as a take-home group activity for a
batch of seventy eight students, divided into thirteen groups. Despite
addressing the same questions, there was no significant overlap in the answers.
Moreover, a wide range of approaches were adopted by the groups in handling
ChatGPT, which in-turn rendered different responses, ultimately drawing
distinct answers. Besides preventing the undesired use of ChatGPT by explicitly
integrating it, the proposed assessment seemingly helped the learners question
the accuracy of its responses. This self-realised skepticism can be expected to
curtail blatant malpractices involving ChatGPT in the long run."

two popular plagiarism detection tools were used to evaluate the originality of
50 essays generated by ChatGPT on various topics. Our results manifest that
ChatGPT has a great potential to generate sophisticated text outputs without
being well caught by the plagiarism check software. In other words, ChatGPT can
create content on many topics with high originality as if they were written by
someone. These findings align with the recent concerns about students using
chatbots for an easy shortcut to success with minimal or no effort. Moreover,
ChatGPT was asked to verify if the essays were generated by itself, as an
additional measure of plagiarism check, and it showed superior performance
compared to the traditional plagiarism-detection tools. The paper discusses the
need for institutions to consider appropriate measures to mitigate potential
plagiarism issues and advise on the ongoing debate surrounding the impact of AI
technology on education. Further implications are discussed in the paper."

2023-12-31,Data Dialogue with ChatGPT: Using Code Interpreter to Simulate and Analyse Experimental Data,"Andrew Low, Z. Yasemin Kalender","Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to fundamentally change the
educational landscape. So far, much of the physics education research relating
to AI has focused on lecture-based assessment and the ability of ChatGPT to
answer conceptual surveys and traditional exam-style questions. In this study,
we shift the focus by investigating ChatGPT's ability to complete an
introductory mechanics laboratory activity by using Code Interpreter, a recent
plugin that allows users to generate and analyse data by writing and running
Python code `behind the scenes'. By uploading a common `spring constant' lab
activity using Code Interpreter, we investigate the ability of ChatGPT to
interpret the activity, generate realistic model data, produce a line-fit, and
calculate the reduced chi square statistic. By analysing our interactions with
ChatGPT, along with the Python code generated by Code Interpreter, we assess
how the quality and accuracy of ChatGPT's responses depends on different levels
of prompt detail. We find that although ChatGPT is capable of completing the
lab activity and generating plausible-looking data, the quality of the output
is highly dependent on the detail and specificity of the text prompts provided.
We find that the data generation process adopted by ChatGPT in this study leads
to heteroscedasticity in the simulated data, which may be difficult for novice
learners to spot. We also find that when real experimental data is uploaded via
Code Interpreter, ChatGPT is capable of correctly plotting and fitting the
data, calculating the spring constant and associated uncertainty, and
calculating the reduced chi square statistic. This work offers new insights
into the capabilities of Code Interpreter within a laboratory setting and
highlights a variety of text-prompt strategies for the effective use of Code
Interpreter in a lab context."

performance across various tasks and have garnered significant attention from
both researchers and practitioners. However, in an educational context, we
still observe a performance gap in generating distractors -- i.e., plausible
yet incorrect answers -- with LLMs for multiple-choice questions (MCQs). In
this study, we propose a strategy for guiding LLMs such as ChatGPT, in
generating relevant distractors by prompting them with question items
automatically retrieved from a question bank as well-chosen in-context
examples. We evaluate our LLM-based solutions using a quantitative assessment
on an existing test set, as well as through quality annotations by human
experts, i.e., teachers. We found that on average 53% of the generated
distractors presented to the teachers were rated as high-quality, i.e.,
suitable for immediate use as is, outperforming the state-of-the-art model. We
also show the gains of our approach 1 in generating high-quality distractors by
comparing it with a zero-shot ChatGPT and a few-shot ChatGPT prompted with
static examples."
2024-02-18,"ChatGPT in Linear Algebra: Strides Forward, Steps to Go","Eli Bagno, Thierry Dana-Picard, Shulamit Reches","As soon as a new technology emerges, the education community explores its
affordances and the possibilities to apply it in education. In this paper, we
analyze sessions with ChatGPT around topics in basic Linear Algebra. We reflect
the process undertaken by the ChatGPT along the recent year in our area of
interest, emphasising the vast improvement that has been done in grappling with
Linear Algebra problems. In particular, the question whether this software can
be a teaching assistant or even somehow replace the human teacher, is
addressed. As of the time this paper is written, the answer is generally
negative. For the small part where the answer can be positive, some reflections
about an original instrumental genesis are given.
  Communication with the software gives the impression to talk to a human, and
sometimes the question is whether the software understands the question or not.
Therefore, the reader's attention is drawn to the fact that ChatGPT works on a
statistical basis and not according to reflection and understanding."

applications, such as ChatGPT, its performance and error analysis for
programming tasks have been subject to research. In this work-in-progress
paper, we explore the potential of such LLMs for computing educators and
learners, as we analyze the feedback it generates to a given input containing
program code. In particular, we aim at (1) exploring how an LLM like ChatGPT
responds to students seeking help with their introductory programming tasks,
and (2) identifying feedback types in its responses. To achieve these goals, we
used students' programming sequences from a dataset gathered within a CS1
course as input for ChatGPT along with questions required to elicit feedback

types of physics problems. ChatGPT (with GPT-4) was queried to solve a total of
40 problems from a college-level engineering physics course. These problems
ranged from well-specified problems, where all data required for solving the
problem was provided, to under-specified, real-world problems where not all
necessary data were given. Our findings show that ChatGPT could successfully
solve 62.5% of the well-specified problems, but its accuracy drops to 8.3% for
under-specified problems. Analysis of the model's incorrect solutions revealed
three distinct failure modes: 1) failure to construct accurate models of the
physical world, 2) failure to make reasonable assumptions about missing data,
and 3) calculation errors. The study offers implications for how to leverage
LLM-augmented instructional materials to enhance STEM education. The insights
also contribute to the broader discourse on AI's strengths and limitations,
